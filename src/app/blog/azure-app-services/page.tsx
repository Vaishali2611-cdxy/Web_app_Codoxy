                <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Azure App Services is a cloud platform that allows you to host web applications, mobile
                    backends, and RESTful APIs in any programming language without worrying about infrastructure
                    management. It supports a variety of languages and frameworks, including .NET, Java,
                    Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to focus
                    on the code rather than the underlying infrastructure.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">
                    Key Components of Azure App Services
                </h2>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>Web Apps: Host and deploy scalable web applications using popular frameworks and languages.</li>
                    <li>API Apps: Create and host RESTful APIs that can be consumed by various clients.</li>
                    <li>Mobile Apps: Build backend services for mobile applications with features like offline sync, push notifications, and authentication.</li>
                    <li>Azure Functions: Execute code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure, ideal for event-driven and serverless architecture.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Benefits of Using Azure App Services</h2>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>
                    <strong>Ease of Use.</strong> Azure App Services abstracts much of the complexity involved
                    in deploying and managing web applications. With its intuitive interface and integration
                    with Visual Studio, GitHub, and other development tools, you can deploy your apps in
                    minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Scalability.</strong> Scaling your applications is as simple as adjusting the
                    settings in the Azure portal. You can scale out to handle increased traffic by adding more
                    instances or scale up by moving to more powerful hardware. Auto-scaling features allow you
                    to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Security.</strong> Azure App Services provides built-in security features like
                    SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and integration with Azure Active Directory (AAD).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Global Reach.</strong> With Azure‚Äôs global network of data centers, you can deploy
                    your applications closer to your users, reducing latency and improving performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Integration with Other Azure Services.</strong> Seamlessly integrates with other
                    Azure services like SQL Database, Azure Storage, and Azure Cognitive Services.
